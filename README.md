# SuKa - Info Gathering Search Engine

This is my College Project inspired from [OSINT](https://osintframework.com/), I wanted to develop something that can hunt down any person through footprints we've.

## How it's working

- Currently it's working on [Google Custom Search API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview) sending query on google api using dorking techniques
- Another feature it has is social media finding through username inspired from [sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock), I'll try integrating sherlock instead of making it's copy function.
- [Argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) library is used to add flags that can determine which function to apply on query.

## My Idea behind it.

Gathering Info through footprints, which tools automatically arranges in order to get the perfect result.
